                                <h3>How often do I need a touch up?</h3>
                                <p>Touch ups are recommended every six months to a year, to keep the color
                                    fresh and the strokes crisp.</p>
                                <h3>Do I have to remove my eyebrow hair?</h3>
                                <p>We do not remove any hair when microblading. We only remove the hair surrounding
                                    the outside of your desired shape.</p>
                                <h3>Can makeup be worn on the brows while healing?</h3>
                                <p>bsolutely not. You will risk the chance of infection. You can start filling
                                    them in once you see all flakes has fallen off.</p>
                                <h3>What products do you use?</h3>
                                <p>All our products are High End, Vegan and cruelty free. Every needle is
                                    sterilized in its own package and thrown out after each use. We DO NOT
                                    use the same needle more then once.</p>
                                <h3>What should I do after the procedure?</h3>
                                <p>Instructions with your aftercare kit will be provided after the treatment.
                                    You just need to keep the area dry and clean. Try to avoid any activities
                                    that consist of water and sweating. If you lose the instructions, please
                                    visit the after care section.</p>
                                <h3>How long does it take to heal?</h3>
                                <p>Healing time varies for each individual . Usually, it takes about 7 to
                                    10 days for the epithelial crust to form and slough off. Your skin will
                                    be considered healed after that happens. Then, the pigment takes some time
                                    to settle into the skin. A good month should pass before we consider the
                                    process complete.</p>
                                <h3>What if I don’t like it?</h3>
                                <p>A good technician always make sure that you are satisfied with the shape
                                    that is drawn on prior to the first appointment. If for some reason you
                                    change your mind and wish to change the shape, we can work with you within
                                    the possibilities to achieve it.</p>
                                <h3>Can microblading work for existing tattoo?</h3>
                                <p>In order to help you we must receive a clear photo of your brows to assess
                                    options. Results varies for each person depending on how the previous tattoo
                                    looks.</p>
                                <h3>What tattoo removal method do you use?</h3>
                                <p>A non surgical method with shorter healing time than Laser treatment.</p>
                                <p>The tattoo removal tool is used in a similar way as tattooing or micropigmenting
                                    , with the same equipment. The tattoo removal formula is placed where the
                                    unwanted tattoo is and almost immediately draw the orginal ink upwards
                                    and out of the skin.</p>
                                <h3>After treatment:</h3>
                                <p>The scab with tattoo ink will be formed over the treated area in the next
                                    few days. While the skin heals, even more unwanted tattoo ink will be drawn
                                    out. The scab will start to peel off naturally, extracting the unwanted
                                    tattoo ink. You are likely to have a secondary scab containing even more
                                    tattoo ink. After the procedure, and as long as you have the scab on the
                                    skin, keep the treated area dry.</p>
                                <p>Several treatments may be required to remove the unwanted tattoo. Average
                                    is between 2-6 pending on the severity of the tattoo. Consultation is required.</p>
