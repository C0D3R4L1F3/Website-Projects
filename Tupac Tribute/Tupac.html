          <h3>Here is a timeline of Tupac Shakur's life:</h3>
          <h5><strong>Early Life</strong></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1971:</strong> June 16, Tupac Shakur was born, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City.</li>
            <li><strong>1972:</strong>  He was renamed after Túpac Amaru II, the 18th-century Peruvian revolutionary who was executed after leading an indigenous uprising against Spanish rule.</li>

In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, "Conquering All Obstacles," in which he said: "our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of. They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is to have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there. Even more important, what we may do to better our world."</li>

			<ul>
			<li><strong>1996:</strong>  On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur rode in Knight's 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan as part of a larger convoy, which included many in Shakur's entourage.</li>
			<li>At 11:15 p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down a window, and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation.</li>
			<li>While in the intensive-care unit, on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging. His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop. He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. (PDT). The official causes of death were noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds. Shakur's body was cremated the next day.</li>

        <blockqoute>
        <p>"Shakur's music and philosophy are rooted in many American, African-American, and world entities, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and liberty. Shakur's love of theater and Shakespeare also influenced his work. A student of the Baltimore School for the Arts where he studied theater, Shakur understood the Shakespearean psychology of inter-gang wars and inter-cultural conflict."</p>
